## About me

I am a Software Developer who is looking to build unique experiences and programs. I've always enjoyed learning and exploring tecyhnology, and the ability to turn that passion into a career has been an incredible experience and opportunity. I have experience in JavaScript, Java, React, CSS, and SpringBoot. I am passionate about learning a variety of new things, such as technology, nature and philosophy. I also enjoy photography, reading and making music. I am building my career in Software Development one line and one page at a time.
